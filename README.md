Datasheet 


Total 1891 papers (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G6apjav94A0R3H4OZXbd7pdmIEfF6m3xbc4LhkRhBSk/edit#gid=0) , I was able to get 1524 PDFs manually. Among them, 254 pdfs (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G6apjav94A0R3H4OZXbd7pdmIEfF6m3xbc4LhkRhBSk/edit#gid=783969714)  have more than 2 “datasheet” by scan_for_words_datasheet ( https://github.com/kusimpkins/datasheet) 

Observations that I made:
1891 links not only the research articles but also these items below,
1. Dissertations/thesis
2. Posters
3. Handbook-policy
4. Foreign language- translation able and non-able
5. Google books-you can’t download but you can search for word “datasheet”
6. Patent
7. Whitepapers

What we need to do is divide up these 254 pdfs (around 50 per person) and review them like other frameworks. You can find these pdfs (you can find these by its their file names) here : https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10gPoI3FqrEUC-pq56sssQCZY9-TdWYS7

Reason why I was not able to get the rest 367 pdfs was
I do not have access to the journals: Springer, Wiley, Taylor & Francis , Academia and some ACM (these are orange color-coded in here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1G6apjav94A0R3H4OZXbd7pdmIEfF6m3xbc4LhkRhBSk/edit#gid=0  and I would love to have help to get these somebody in our group
